### Run

Clone the project.
 ```
git clone
```
You first need to navigate into the explode module.
```
cd explode
```

Fetch the dependencies:
```
flutter pub get
```
Build it as an AAR:
```
flutter build aar
```

After these steps, you should be able to build the project. The google.service.json file is added through the pipeline during the release process. To compile the project locally, you need to create and add your own google.service.json file.

#### Contribute

During the commit process, both commit-msg and lint checks are automatically executed. Committing triggers the lint task. If any issues arise, you can manually trigger the lint check with the following command:

```
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```
Ensure your commit message follows this format:
```
[DEV]||[FIX]|[REFACTOR] [commit message]
```

Git hooks are set up to enforce linting and commit message checks. If you encounter any issues with the hooks, you can reinstall them by running:

```
./gradlew installGitHook
```

If you make any changes in the <b>explode</b> module, donâ€™t forget to run
```
cd explode && flutter build aar
```
